## üöÄ Getting Started

### ‚öôÔ∏è 1. Setting Up Your Environment
To contribute, set up a local development environment:
1. **Install a C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have a C++17-compliant compiler installed, such as `g++` (GCC 7.0+) or `clang++` (Clang 5.0+).
2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gerivanc/dnapass.git
   cd dnapass
   ```
3. **Install development tools** (optional, but recommended):
   - **clang-format**: For automatic code formatting.
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install clang-format  # On Debian/Ubuntu
     # Or use your package manager (e.g., brew on macOS, choco on Windows)
     ```
   - **clang-tidy**: For linting and static analysis (optional).
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install clang-tidy
     ```
4. **Compile the project**:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 dnapass_generator.cpp -o dnapass_generator
   ```
   Alternatively, use `clang++`:
   ```bash
   clang++ -std=c++17 dnapass_generator.cpp -o dnapass_generator
   ```

### üì¢ 2. Reporting Issues
If you find a bug, have a feature request, or notice documentation that needs improvement:
- **Search existing issues**: Check the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/gerivanc/dnapass/issues) to avoid duplicates.
- **Use templates**: Follow the issue templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` for bug reports or feature requests.
- **Provide details**: Include a clear title, description, steps to reproduce (if applicable), expected behavior, and screenshots or logs.
- **Security issues**: For vulnerabilities, follow the process in [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/gerivanc/dnapass/blob/main/SECURITY.md) instead of opening a public issue.

### üîÑ 3. Submitting Pull Requests
To contribute code, documentation, or other changes, submit a pull request (PR):
1. **Fork the repository**:
   - Click the "Fork" button on the [repository page](https://github.com/gerivanc/dnapass).
   - Clone your fork:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/dnapass.git
     cd dnapass
     ```
2. **Create a branch**:
   - Use a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/add-new-mode`, `fix/bug-entropy-calc`):
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
     ```
3. **Make changes**:
   - Follow the coding standards below.
   - Test changes locally (see "Testing" section).
   - Update documentation (e.g., `README.md`, inline comments) if necessary.
   - Run formatting tools:
     ```bash
     clang-format -i dnapass_generator.cpp
     ```
     Optionally, run `clang-tidy` for linting:
     ```bash
     clang-tidy dnapass_generator.cpp -- -std=c++17
     ```
4. **Commit changes**:
   - Use clear, concise commit messages following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format (e.g., `feat: add new password mode`, `fix: correct entropy calculation`):
     ```bash
     git commit -m "feat: describe your change"
     ```
5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
6. **Open a pull request**:
   - Go to the [repository](https://github.com/gerivanc/dnapass) and click "New pull request".
   - Select your branch and provide a detailed description of your changes.
   - Reference related issues (e.g., "Fixes #123").
   - Ensure your PR passes the GitHub Actions CI checks (if configured).

### üìú 4. Coding Standards
To maintain consistency and security, adhere to these guidelines:
- **C++ Version**: Use C++17 or higher, as specified in the compilation instructions.
- **Style**: Follow the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) or [LLVM Coding Standards](https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html). Use `clang-format` for consistent formatting.
- **Comments**: Write clear, English comments for all functions and complex logic. Use Doxygen-style comments for functions if adding documentation.
- **Security**: Use `std::random_device` and `std::mt19937` for random number generation. Avoid insecure functions like `rand()`. If introducing new dependencies, justify their necessity and security.
- **File Structure**: Keep changes within the existing structure (e.g., core logic in `dnapass_generator.cpp`).
- **Licensing**: By contributing, you agree that your contributions are licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/gerivanc/dnapass/blob/main/LICENSE.md).

### üß™ 5. Testing
Ensure your changes do not break existing functionality:
- **Manual Testing**:
  - Run the compiled binary with different configurations:
    ```bash
    ./dnapass_generator
    ```
    Enter different password lengths (e.g., 8, 12, 128) to verify output.
- **Cross-Platform Testing**:
  - Test on Linux, macOS, and Windows to ensure compatibility.
  - Use different compilers (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`, MSVC) to verify portability.
- **Automated Tests**:
  - Currently, the project does not include automated tests. If adding tests, consider using a framework like [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) or [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest). Place tests in a `tests/` directory. Example compilation with Catch2:
    ```bash
    g++ -std=c++17 tests/test_dnapass.cpp -o test_dnapass
    ./test_dnapass
    ```
  - Contributions that add test coverage are highly encouraged.
- **Validation**:
  - Verify that password generation meets NIST standards (80+ bits of entropy).
  - Check that passwords include required character types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters).

### ‚úÖ 6. Pull Request Review Process
