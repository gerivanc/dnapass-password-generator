## üìå Getting Started

1. **Read the Documentation**:
   - Review the [README.md](https://github.com/gerivanc/dnapass-password-generator/blob/main/README.md) for an overview of the project.
   - Check the [DNAPASSCALCULATION.md](https://github.com/gerivanc/dnapass-password-generator/blob/main/DNAPASSCALCULATION.md) for details on the password generation methodology.
   - See the [RELEASE.md](https://github.com/gerivanc/dnapass-password-generator/blob/main/RELEASE.md) for version-specific details.

2. **Set Up Your Environment**:
   - Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/gerivanc/dnapass-password-generator.git
     cd dnapass-password-generator
     ```
   - Ensure you have a C++17-compliant compiler (e.g., `g++` 7.0+ or `clang++` 5.0+).
   - Install CMake for building the project:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install cmake  # On Debian/Ubuntu
     # Or use your package manager (e.g., brew on macOS, choco on Windows)
     ```
   - (Optional) Install `clang-format` for code formatting:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install clang-format  # On Debian/Ubuntu
     ```
   - Build the project:
     ```bash
     mkdir build && cd build
     cmake ..
     cmake --build .
     ```

3. **Check Coding Standards**:
   - Use `clang-format` to ensure consistent code style:
     ```bash
     clang-format -i dnapass_generator.cpp
     ```
   - Follow C++17 standards and avoid external dependencies beyond standard libraries.
