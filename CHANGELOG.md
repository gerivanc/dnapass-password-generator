All notable changes to the üß¨ DNAPass Password Generator project are documented in this file. This project adheres to the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) standard, which ensures a structured and human-readable format for tracking changes. By following this approach, we provide clear visibility into the project's evolution, making it easier for users and contributors to understand what has been added, changed, or fixed in each release. Additionally, the project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) (SemVer), which uses a versioning scheme of MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. This practice enhances predictability and compatibility by clearly indicating the impact of updates: major versions for breaking changes, minor versions for new features, and patch versions for bug fixes. Together, these standards improve the project's maintainability, transparency, and usability for developers and security enthusiasts.

- Support for automated password generation via input redirection (e.g., `echo "75" | ./dnapass_generator`) documented in `README.md`.
- Project structure section in `README.md` to clarify the organization of source files, headers, and GitHub Actions workflows.
- GitHub Actions workflow badge for `cpp-release.yml` in `README.md` to display release status alongside the build status.
- Adi√ß√£o de verifica√ß√µes de depura√ß√£o no workflow `cpp-build.yml` para exibir o diret√≥rio atual e o conte√∫do do `CMakeLists.txt` no Windows.

### Changed
- Moved the definition of the `special_chars` constant to `dnapass_generator.hpp` as an inline variable to resolve linkage issues.
- Adjusted the structure of lambdas in `dnapass_generator.cpp` to correctly reference `special_chars` from the namespace.
- Updated the `CMakeLists.txt` files in the root directory and `dnapass_password_generator` subfolder to support modular compilation across multiple operating systems and compilers.
- Improved the GitHub Actions workflow `cpp-release.yml` by adding Homebrew installation verification for `macos-latest` to prevent `brew: command not found` errors.
- Consolidated `CMakeLists.txt` files into a single file at the project root, updating source file paths and include directories for clarity and maintainability.
- Moved `special_chars` constant from `dnapass_generator.cpp` to `dnapass_generator.hpp` with `inline` declaration to improve code organization and resolve linkage issues.
- Updated GitHub Actions workflows (`cpp-build.yml` and `cpp-release.yml`) to use `apt-get` instead of `brew` on Ubuntu and to point CMake to the project root.
- Enhanced `README.md` with clearer instructions for Linux users, including commands for installing dependencies and a detailed build process.
- Consolidated `CMakeLists.txt` files into a single file at the project root, updating source file paths (`dnapass_password_generator/dnapass_generator.cpp`, `dnapass_password_generator/main.cpp`) and include directories for improved maintainability.

- Ajuste no workflow `cpp-build.yml` para usar `%GITHUB_WORKSPACE%\dnapass-password-generator` como caminho fonte no CMake, garantindo a detec√ß√£o do `CMakeLists.txt`.

### Fixed
- Resolved compilation error due to missing `<map>` header in `dnapass_generator.hpp`, enabling the use of `std::map` for `ambiguous_chars`.
- Fixed redefinition error of `struct PasswordResult` by removing duplicate declaration in `dnapass_generator.cpp`, ensuring it is defined only in the header.
