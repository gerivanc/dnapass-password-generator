Just like every DNA sequence is unique to each living being, **üß¨ DNAPass** creates digitally exclusive passwords ‚Äî unpredictable and packed with high entropy. Built in **C++**, this secure generator uses DNA-inspired patterns to produce strong, resilient passwords suitable for high-security environments.

With a command-line interface (CLI), users can customize password length from **8 to 128 characters**. DNAPass‚Äôs algorithm leverages character diversity, ambiguity resolution, and DNA-mimicking variations to deliver robust, one-of-a-kind passwords for **developers and cybersecurity enthusiasts.**

# üìú Disclaimer
Do not attempt to memorize the passwords generated by this tool. Instead, use a reliable password manager, such as [Bitwarden¬©](https://bitwarden.com/), which I personally recommend. The only password you should memorize is the master password for your password manager's vault, created with a strong combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible to enhance security.

# ‚ú® Features
- Generates passwords with lengths between 8 and 128 characters.
- Supports uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
- Uses primary and secondary DNA sequence sets for unique password generation.
- Ensures at least 4 special characters, 2‚Äì3 digits, 10% uppercase, and 1 lowercase.
- Command-line interface for flexible usage.
- No external dependencies; uses C++ standard libraries.

# üìã Requirements

Update and install the environments required for the installation. 

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
sudo apt install cmake
sudo apt install g++
sudo apt install clang
```

After installing the environments, confirm and verify the installed versions. 

```bash
git --version
cmake --version
g++ --version
clang --version
```

---

# üíæ Installation

Cloning the repository to install packages.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gerivanc/dnapass-password-generator.git
cd dnapass-password-generator
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

---

# üõ† Command Line Interface
## Usage

Method 1.
Call the function by question to generate the password by choosing between 8-128 characters:

```bash
./dnapass_generator
```

Method 2. - Automated Mode. 
Call to generate the password by choosing a 12-character password. In the function, enter the number of characters between 8 and 128. 

```bash
echo "45" | ./dnapass_generator
```

### Troubleshooting
- **Error: "cmake: command not found"**:
  Install CMake with `sudo apt install cmake`.
- **Error: "g++: command not found"**:
  Install `g++` with `sudo apt install g++`.
- **Error: "./dnapass_generator: No such file or directory"**:
  Ensure the build step completed successfully. Run `ls` to check if `dnapass_generator` exists in the `build` folder. If not, repeat the `cmake ..` and `cmake --build .` steps.
- **Permission denied**:
  Run `chmod +x dnapass_generator` to make the executable runnable, then try `./dnapass_generator` again.
  
## Post installation
  
  After the first installation, there's no need to reinstall everything in your environment. Simply open the terminal (CLI) in the environment where the repository was installed and access the folder with the command:
  
```bash
cd dnapass-password-generator/build
```

Then run the desired function to generate passwords as per your needs.

# üìä DNAPass Calculation Methodology
DNAPass generates passwords by:
1. Selecting random DNA sequences from primary (90%) or secondary (10%) sets.
2. Resolving ambiguous characters (e.g., 'N' to A/T/C/G).
3. Adjusting for length and enforcing character diversity (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters).
4. Shuffling the final password to ensure randomness.

See the [DNAPASSCALCULATION.md](https://github.com/gerivanc/dnapass-password-generator/blob/main/DNAPASSCALCULATION.md) for details.
