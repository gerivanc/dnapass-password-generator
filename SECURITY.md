# 🛡️ Security Best Practices

To ensure the secure use of DNAPass Password Generator:
- Use a C++17-compliant compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`) and keep it updated to the latest version.
- Compile the tool from a verified source. Check the integrity of the source code by verifying the commit hash on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gerivanc/dnapass).
- Store generated passwords securely using a trusted password manager, such as [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/).
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for accounts using passwords generated by DNAPass.

# 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the DNAPass Password Generator, please report it promptly to protect the community. We consider vulnerabilities such interchange as cryptographic weaknesses, insecure random number generation, or code execution flaws within scope. Follow these steps:

1. **Where to Report**: Email [dean-grumbly-plop@duck.com](mailto:dean-grumbly-plop@duck.com) with a detailed description of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce, impact, and affected versions. For sensitive reports, request our PGP key for encrypted communication.
2. **Expected Response Time**: You will receive an acknowledgment within 48 hours. A detailed update, including assessment and resolution plan, will be provided within 7 business days.
3. **Resolution Process**:
   - **Accepted Vulnerabilities**: We will prioritize a fix based on severity (e.g., critical issues patched within 30 days) and deploy it in the next supported release. We may coordinate with CVE authorities for public disclosure.
   - **Declined Vulnerabilities**: If the issue is not reproducible, out of scope, or not a vulnerability, you will be notified with an explanation.
4. **Responsible Disclosure Timeline**:
   - Acknowledgment: Within 48 hours.
   - Initial assessment: Within 7 business days.
   - Patch release: Within 30–60 days, depending on severity.
   - Public disclosure: Coordinated with the reporter, typically after the patch is released.
5. **Confidentiality**: Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have resolved it and provided clearance. Responsible reporters may be acknowledged publicly (with consent) in release notes or a project "Hall of Fame."
6. **Contact for Queries**: For questions about the process, email [dean-grumbly-plop@duck.com](mailto:dean-grumbly-plop@duck.com).
