## ðŸ“‹ Overview
The ** ðŸ§¬ DNAPass Password Generator** v0.1.3 is now available! This initial release introduces a secure C++ tool for generating strong passwords inspired by DNA sequences. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) with customizable password lengths (8â€“128 characters) and ensures high entropy, exceeding NIST standards (80+ bits). The project includes a GitHub Actions badge in the documentation to reflect the status of CI/CD workflows.

## âœ¨ What's New
- Completed total of 200 sequences for nucleotides in code 'dnapass_generator.cpp' function 'const std::vector<std::string> primary_sequences = { '
- GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow for automated testing and building across multiple platforms
- Multi-platform support (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows) with GCC and Clang compilers
- Automated release process triggered by version tags
- Comprehensive error handling and input validation in password generation
- Initial public release of DNAPass Password Generator
- Completed total of 200 sequences for nucleotides in code 'dnapass_generator.cpp'
- Resolved CMake configuration issues preventing successful builds on macOS and Windows
- Fixed `special_chars` variable declaration and linking errors across multiple compilation units
- Corrected recursive password generation to include maximum attempt limits
